This repository is used to practice Machine Learning algorithms.
Some of the algorithms are copied with/without modification from the book
"Python Machine Learning With Scikit and TensorFlow".

The rest Python algorithms are implemented by myself to have a good
understanding of the popular supervised, unsupervised ML algorithms.
